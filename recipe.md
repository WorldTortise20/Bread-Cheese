Step one: Take a pan and heat it for 10 minutes. 
Step two: Pull out bread and apply cheese on top- no need to put too big of a slice on (or put it on till your heart's content).
Step three: Place bread and cheese on top of the pan after the 10 minutes.
Step four: Place a lid on top of the pan, making sure the heat stays in. This allows the cheese to melt quickly.
Step five: When cheese looks good enough to pull out, take out the bread and let it cool.
Step six: Apply garlic salt (and any outher dressing of your choice), pour sauce (as a dip), and enjoy!
